# AEWeb

This is AEWeb Cli repository!

This command line interface enables you to deploy files/ websites / folders (.jpg, .png, .pdf, .html, etc...) on top of Archethic Public Blockchain.

## Instructions

To get the AEWeb CLI, you need NodeJS (latest version) installed. Then you need to install the CLI, using:

```bash
npm install aeweb -g
```

To check if AEWeb CLI is installed successfully, try :

```bash
aeweb about
```

To generate address you need -

- `seed` is a string representing the transaction chain entropy to be able to derive and generate the keys for the transactions
- `index` is the number of transactions in the chain, to generate the current and the next public key

```bash
aeweb generate-address --seed myseedphrase --index 0
```

To deploy files, folder or website -

- `seed` is a string representing the transaction chain entropy to be able to derive and generate the keys
- `endpoint` is the URL of a welcome node to receive the transaction
- `path` is the path of the folder or file you want to deploy

```bash
aeweb deploy --seed myseedphrase --endpoint https://testnet.archethic.net --path ./website
```

To enable SSL certificates and HTTPS websites you can need -

- `ssl-certificate` PEM file of the public certificate for your domain
- `ssl-key` PEM file of the private key related to your certificate for your domain (The key will be encrypted for the Archethic nodes - so only them would be able to decrypt it to deliver your website in HTTPS)

```bash
aeweb deploy --seed myseedphrase --endpoint https://testnet.archethic.net --path ./website --ssl-certificate example-com-cert.pem --ssl-key example-com-key.pem
```
